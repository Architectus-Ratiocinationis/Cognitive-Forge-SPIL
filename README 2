# Cognitive Forge & Simulated Parallel Inferential Logic (SPIL)

Welcome to the official repository for the **Cognitive Forge** and the **Simulated Parallel Inferential Logic (SPIL)** framework. This project is dedicated to providing a powerful, structured methodology for advanced AI-driven reasoning and a tool for automating its implementation.

## Licensing

This project uses a **dual-licensing** model to balance community collaboration with sustainable development.

## What is SPIL?

Simulated Parallel Inferential Logic (SPIL) is a framework for guiding a Large Language Model to simulate a sophisticated, multi-layered reasoning process. It enables an AI to manage multiple, distinct streams of logic simultaneously, making it ideal for solving complex, multi-perspective problems where creative synthesis is required.

For a deep dive into the philosophy and architecture, please read the [**SPIL White Paper**](white-paper/Simulated-Parallel-Inferential-Logic-SPIL.md).

## What is the Cognitive Forge?

The Cognitive Forge is a sophisticated meta-prompt that acts as an automated SPIL prompt engineer. It takes a user's natural-language problem and generates a bespoke, fully-featured SPIL prompt tailored to solve it. Its recursive design allows it to use its own advanced structure as a template, ensuring a high-quality, robust output.

To get started with the Cognitive Forge, see the [**Cognitive Forge v4 Prompt and Explanation**](cognitive-forge/Cognitive-Forge-v4.md).

## How to Get Started

### 1. Read the Foundational Documents
To fully understand the power and philosophy of this methodology, we strongly recommend starting with these two documents:
* [**The SPIL White Paper**](white-paper/Simulated-Parallel-Inferential-Logic-SPIL.md): Explains the "why" and "what" of the architecture.
* [**The Cognitive Forge Prompt**](cognitive-forge/Cognitive-Forge-v4.md): Explains the "how" of the automated implementation.

### 2. ðŸš€ Ready to Use: The Complete Prompt File
For the easiest way to get started, we have prepared a single Markdown file that contains the entire, fully assembled prompt structure needed to run the Cognitive Forge, as described in the white paper.

Simply formulate your request, copy the contents of the file below, paste it into your LLM chat session, and then add your request in the designated section.

* [**Copy the Full, Ready-to-Use Cognitive Forge Prompt**](ready-to-use/COMPLETE_FORGE_PROMPT.md)

**IMPORTANT:** The framework requires the entirety of the SPIL White Paper and the Cognitive Forge Prompt to be in the chat session context to function correctly. The linked file above handles this for you.

### 3. Review the Best Practices
To help you get the most out of this powerful framework, we have compiled a comprehensive guide detailing the best practices for using both SPIL and the Cognitive Forge. This guide covers everything from foundational principles like session management to advanced recursive techniques for R&D and stress-testing your own ideas.

* [**Read the Best Practices Guide**](best-practices/Best_Practices.md)

### 4. Explore the Examples
The `examples` directory showcases the framework's versatility and the quality of its output across different complex domains. These are not just simple demonstrations; they are deep, expert-level analyses generated by the SPIL process.

* **Included Examples:**
    * A deep legal analysis of a presidential executive order, simulating a Supreme Court hearing.
    * The generation of a novel machine learning algorithm (`Stochastic Kernel Mixture v2.1`) and a professional white paper detailing its architecture and implementation.
    * A strategic plan for wildlife conservation that develops a novel, proactive ecosystem management model.
