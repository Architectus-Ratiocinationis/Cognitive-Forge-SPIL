## What is SPIL?

Simulated Parallel Inferential Logic (SPIL) is a framework for guiding a Large Language Model to simulate a sophisticated, multi-layered reasoning process. It enables an AI to manage multiple, distinct streams of logic simultaneously, making it ideal for complex problem-solving.

For a deep dive into the philosophy and architecture, please read the [**SPIL White Paper**](white-paper/SPIL_White_Paper.md).

## What is the Cognitive Forge?

The Cognitive Forge is a meta-prompt that acts as an automated SPIL prompt engineer. It takes a user's natural-language problem and generates a bespoke, fully-featured SPIL prompt tailored to solve it.

To get started with the Cognitive Forge, see the [**Cognitive Forge Prompt**](cognitive-forge/Cognitive_Forge_Prompt.md). To use the prompt effectively, you MUST follow the procedure in the white paper section 5.1.

## How to Use

1.  **Read the White Paper:** To fully understand the power of this methodology, it is highly recommended to start with the [SPIL White Paper](white-paper/SPIL_White_Paper.md).
2.  **Use the Cognitive Forge:** Follow the instructions in the white paper section 5.2 [Cognitive Forge Prompt](cognitive-forge/Cognitive_Forge_Prompt.md) to generate your own custom SPIL prompts. **The framework must have the entirety of the SPIL White Paper, and the Cognitive Forge Prompt in the chat session to be able to properly utilize the Cognitive Forge!**
4.  **Explore the Examples:** See the `examples` directory for demonstrations of how to structure a request and what a generated SPIL prompt looks like.
